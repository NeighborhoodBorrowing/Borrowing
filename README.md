# Borrowing

A web application modeled loosely after OfferUp and Letgo, but instead of purchasing unwanted items from other users, items can be borrowed for a set amount of time.

## Getting Started

Once cloned to your local machine, make sure your local SQL server is up and running. Manually create a database entitiled, 'borrowing_db', then feed in the seeds. Once navigating to the cloned directory, enter 'node server.js' inside of your terminal.

### Prerequisites

Package.json included. Simply run npm install to install dependencies.
